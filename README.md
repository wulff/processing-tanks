First make sure that you have the dependencies installed:

* [Grab processing.js 1.4.2](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/tree/v1.4.2) from GitHub and save it as processing.js in the root directory
* [Grab the minim.js shim](https://github.com/Pomax/Pjs-2D-Game-Engine/blob/master/minim.js) from GitHub and save it as minim.js in the root directory

In the root directory, run the following command to start a web server on port 8000:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

You can now access the application on `http://localhost:8000/`.
